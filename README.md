# Classic-Models-Sales-Analysis-using-MySQL-POWER-BI
This projects aims to explore the business sales data of Classic Models, a retailer of scale models of classic cars, to understand the sale trends of different products,customer behaviour and top performing products.

Overview
The data set I used for this project can be found here Script+for+Classic+Models.txt .And it contains three years worth of sales data of different product lines across different countries. The aim of this project is to understand the overall sales performance of this company.

Problem Statement:
1. Give an overview of sales for 2004.
2. Give a breakdown of products that are commonly purchased together and the product which are rarely purchased together.
3. Show breakdown of sales by customer's credit limits.
4. Show customer's sales value change from previous their order.
5. Show Office sales by customer country.
6. Show customers affected by late shipping.
7. Give breakdown of customers who go over their credit limits.

For this project I wanted to get some more numerical data using a relational database with multiple tables. This will allow me to showcase some different analytical skills by using:

1.Joins in SQL
2.Pivot tables in Excel
3.Data visualisation is Power BI

SQL
I've decided to start with SQL, so I've imported the data into MySQL workbench.

I've also downloaded the Sample Database's Diagram that shows the relationships between the tables. This way I can easily find the primary and foreign keys that I can use to connect two separate tables when performing joins.
